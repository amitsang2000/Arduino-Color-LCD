How to use:
Copy the contents of the repository inside arduino/hardware/libraries/ColorLCD. Open the sketch in the "examples" directory for an example. Check ColorLCD.h for a list of public functions.

Have fun!

Version 0.1.1 (dev version: Dec 28, 2009 - now)
This is the new development version. Working on some performance optimizations. Change log from version 0.1:
* replaced the loop used for bit banging with a sequential structure; reset() now takes only 111 milliseconds instead of 183
* it doesn't hold the font bitmaps in ram, it loads them from flash when needed. This saves about 500 bytes of RAM, and it seems it isn't slower.

Version 0.1 (Dec 28, 2009)
First release. At the moment, this library allows you to display text, rectangles and bitmaps. Most of the development has been focused on making text output as powerful and simple as possible. It is very similar with using the serial port from the built-in Arduino library.

Note: The Nokia 6100/6610/etc display clones are supposed to use either a Philips PCF8833 controller, or an Epson S1D15G10 controller. I bought my display from eBay and I'm not sure which controller does it use because it doesn't seem to work exactly like one of those two. Maybe the controller itself is a clone. In any case, this is the code that works for me. If it doesn't work for you, contact me.
